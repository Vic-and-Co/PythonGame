So like we're gonna make it so you can unlock three attacks total (four if theres time) that unlocks based on the boss you beat up
supers can also be unlocked, but only one can be selected at a time:

Melee (You start with this):
    Normal: sword hit; attacks once in a direction per mouse click
    Super: sword tornado thingy; summons a circle of swords that does damage all around you for set amount of time
